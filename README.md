# detection-sigma-exercises 🕵️‍♂️✨

Welcome to **detection-sigma-exercises** — a simple repository where I write and share Sigma rules based on real detection scenarios.  

## What’s inside
A collection of Sigma rules that I’ve recreated from descriptions provided on the [SOC LABS website](https://www.soc-labs.top/en/detection).  
Each rule reflects how I would translate a problem statement into a practical detection.  

## Why
I wanted to document these exercises in order to show that I can write effective Sigma rules and continuously refine my craft.
